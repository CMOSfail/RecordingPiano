# Recording Piano in C#

This is a nice assignment I was given at school :)

Recording Piano is a C# project for recording musical notes on the Bb scale, and then beeping them out loud!

## Installation

Donwload the project, and then open it in Visual Studio 2017 or later (May work on older versions)


## Usage

```csharp
int Run the code = 1;

for (int i = 0; i < instructions.Length(); i++)
{
   follow the instructions!
}

Console.WriteLine("That is it!, You are done!");

```

## Contributing

I would love to see this project skyrocketing, adding new features and improving the current ones.
So pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.
